"""`catalog/tools.yml` must describe the actions this repository actually uses.

Two silent divergences, both found by comparing the catalog to the tree rather
than by any check:

* **`used_by` was incomplete.** `actions/checkout` declared 9 workflows and was
  used in 46; `setup-python` declared 3 of 6; `upload-artifact` 2 of 7. The
  field is documented as "workflow paths that consume the tool", and it is what
  a reviewer reads to answer "which workflows does this SHA bump affect?" — so
  an incomplete list gives a confidently wrong answer during exactly the review
  that matters most.

* **Four actions were not registered at all**: `EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny-action`
  and `taiki-e/install-action` (rust-supply-chain.yml), and both
  `google/clusterfuzzlite/actions/*` (clusterfuzzlite.yml). The pin validators
  check pin *format*, never catalog *membership*, so three newly added workflows
  bypassed the registry while the gate stayed green.

The registry is derived from the tree here, so neither can recur. `used_by`
covers `.github/workflows/` only; examples pin the reusables, not the actions.
