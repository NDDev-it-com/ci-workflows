"""Pinning an action by SHA does not pin what that action calls.

`check_pinned_actions.py` proves every `uses:` written here is a full commit SHA.
That is one level deep. A composite action's own `action.yml` may name further
actions by tag, and GitHub resolves the **entire** nested graph at job setup --
so under the repository control "require actions to be pinned to a full-length
commit SHA", which `docs/00` and the consumer-adoption skill both recommend, the
job is refused before a single step runs:

    The action actions/cache@v5 is not allowed in NDDev-it-com/ci-workflows
    because all actions must be pinned to a full-length commit SHA.

That is how `dart-flutter-ci.yml` and `qt-ci.yml` turned out to be unusable in
any organisation following this library's own advice. See issue #150.

The first version of this check claimed that property and did not establish it.
Three gaps, each found by testing it rather than reading it:

* **It read YAML with a regular expression** anchored on `uses:` as the first
  token of a line, so the ordinary composite form `- uses: owner/action@ref`
  matched nothing. The sibling expression for this repository's own workflows
  handled `(?:-\\s*)?`; this one did not, and the difference was one group.
* **It did not recurse.** A nested reference that was itself a SHA ended the
  walk, so anything at depth two or beyond was never looked at.
* **It could not tell throttling from a refusal.** ~43 sequential API calls with
  no pacing hit a secondary rate limit, and the 403 was reported as
  "unreachable", which reads as a broken third party rather than as this check
  asking too fast. `maintenance.yml` filed exactly that on its first run.

Advisory tier. It reads other repositories over the network, and what a third
party writes in its own `action.yml` is not a property of this tree.
