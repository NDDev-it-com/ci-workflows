"""Hold the one actionlint suppression to the scope it claims.

`.github/actionlint.yaml` silences a single actionlint diagnostic: v1.7.12 — the
current release, and the one `actionlint.yml` pins — models the `job` context as
`{check_run_id, container, services, status}` and therefore reports
`job.workflow_repository`, `job.workflow_sha` and `job.workflow_file_path` as
undefined. Those three are real, and the three SDK reusables need them to name
themselves rather than their caller.

A suppression is a hole in a gate, so it gets a gate of its own. This validator
proves four things a reader would otherwise have to take on trust:

* the config silences exactly one pattern, scoped to exactly the files that need
  it — nothing repository-wide;
* the pattern still rejects a typo. `job.workflow_shaa` and any other unknown
  property must keep being reported, which is checked by running the regex
  against the real diagnostic text rather than by reading it;
* the files that reference `job.workflow_*` are exactly the files the glob
  covers, in both directions, so the scope cannot quietly widen or go stale;
* no workflow references a `job` property that is neither modelled by actionlint
  nor one of the three known-real ones — the case actionlint can no longer catch
  here.

Everything above is a property of the tree, so this is a blocking check. Whether
upstream has since learned these properties is a fact about somebody else's
release schedule and does not belong in this tier.
